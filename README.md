# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview
This project involves performing an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset. The Titanic dataset is one of the most well-known datasets in machine learning and provides a historical look at the passengers aboard the Titanic and whether they survived the tragedy.

---

## Dataset
The dataset can be accessed from the [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data). It includes information about passengers such as:

- **Demographics**: Age, Sex, and Passenger Class (Pclass)
- **Family Information**: Number of siblings/spouses and parents/children aboard (SibSp, Parch)
- **Ticket and Fare Details**
- **Embarkation Point**
- **Survival Status**: The target variable indicating if the passenger survived (1) or not (0)

---

## Objectives
1. **Understand the Dataset**:
   - Analyze the structure and distribution of data.
   - Identify key features and their relationships to survival status.

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handle missing values (e.g., Age, Cabin, Embarked).
   - Address outliers and inconsistencies in the dataset.

3. **Feature Analysis**:
   - Explore the relationship between survival and key features like age, gender, passenger class, and fare.
   - Use statistical summaries and visualizations to uncover patterns.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Generate visual insights using histograms, bar plots, heatmaps, and pair plots.
   - Highlight correlations and feature importance.

## Methodology
1. **Data Exploration**:
   - Inspect the dataset for missing and erroneous values.
   - Analyze distributions of continuous and categorical features.

2. **Visualization**:
   - Use tools like Seaborn and Matplotlib to create:
     - Histograms for numeric variables (e.g., age, fare).
     - Bar plots for categorical variables (e.g., Pclass, Sex, Embarked).
     - Heatmaps for correlations among features.

3. **Insights and Observations**:
   - Document significant findings, such as the survival rates by class, gender, and embarkation point.
